BPjs Execution Runtime
----------------------

This program takes a series of BPjs files, and executes them 
as a single BProgram.

Use "-" to also read from stdin.

Program log and event sequence are written to stdout.

Program output has the following format:
* Lines that start with "#":
     -  program load messages.
* Lines that start with hyphens and ":" (e.g. "  --: TEXT"):
     -  Program listener messages
* Other lines are output from the BProgram itself.
